# To-Do-Pro
This a to do list project in which you can add new task and can categorize them in done or not done also in the end you can delete them!
<h2>What is this?</h2>
This is a <i><b>ToDoList</b></i> project made up of django and my soul.
This is a basic website without frontend (will work on it later),
In this you can add a new task with a title and a description, and you can categorize them in <i><b>done or not done</b></i> and in the end you alse delete them!

<h2>How to run it?</h2>
I assume you have python 3, django and numpy coz, it is common though.<br>
1. Clone this repo in your pc.<br>
2. Open terminal in the root directory of the project.<br>
3. Run command <i><b>python manage.py runserver</b></i>
<br><br>
And boom! it is up and running.
Enjoy and also feel free to help me make this project even better!!
